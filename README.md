# PandaLab Documentation Hub

This repository serves as the central hub for all PandaLab documentation.

It collects and organizes technical, architectural, and design information used across all projects.  
All members and collaborators can refer to this repository to find up-to-date internal documentation.

## Structure
- `/wiki` — internal guides, documentation, and contribution notes
- `/architecture` — system diagrams, backend/frontend structures (to be added)
- `/design` — design principles, brand materials, and guidelines (to be added)

## Contribution
For now, contributions are not made through pull requests.  
If you want to contribute to PandaLab’s projects or documentation, please contact the organization directly via email.
